DarthBeans
=========

Dark Theme for Netbeans based on the excellent [Soda Theme by Ian Hill](http://buymeasoda.com/)

## Design

## Installation

Grab the [zip](https://github.com/ravenlife/DarthBeans/zipball/master) and import to Netbeans preferences

## Release Notes

Unfortunately Netbeans does not have as many configurable options as Sublime Text 2 does, therefore the theme is not an exact replica of Soda Theme. I have bumped a ticket over at Netbeans in the hopes that we will get support in future versions.
